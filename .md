## machine learning data processing

### Data Types
1. Nominal - is for mutual exclusive, but not ordered, categories
> mutual exclusive - 서로가 서로에게 어떠한 영향도 미치지 않는 것<br>
> 순서, 카테고리 x<br>
> genotype, blood type, zip code, gender, race, eye color, political party<br>

2. Ordinal - is one where the order matters but not the difference between values
> 순서는 중요하지만 value 사이에 차이는 없음

3. Interval - is a measurement where the difference between two values is meaningful


4. Ratio - has all the properties of an interval varialbe, and also has a clear definition of 0.0.
